# :skull: **Hangman Game** :skull:

This app will randomly select a word and display the number of blanks associated with the word chosen. The user will then have to guess letters to build the word. If the letter chosen by the user is within the word, it will take the place of the blank in the display. On the other hand, if the letter is not in the word, the number of attempts left goes down; the user can only make 6 wrong guesses before the game ends (head, body, leg, leg, arm, arm).
